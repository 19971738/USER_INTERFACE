# USER_INTERFACE
In this project, you can see we are building a user interface using pointers to speed up the interaction between the machine and the user.
I am including a the main file which include the code written in C which you can just go ahead and compile it using MPLAB
I am also including the library used to control the LCD 16x2
I am also including the simulation on PROTEUS.
HAVE FUN! :)
